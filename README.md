# Bookstore SQL Analysis Project

## üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates **relational database analysis using SQL** with three interconnected datasets:
- **Book Dataset** ‚Üí Book details (Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, Price, Stock)
- **Customer Dataset** ‚Üí Customer information (Customer ID, Name, Age, Location, Membership)
- **Order Dataset** ‚Üí Transaction records (Order ID, Customer ID, Book ID, Quantity, Order Date, Payment Mode)

The project replicates a **bookstore management system**, focusing on customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue insights.

## üìä Sample SQL Queries
```sql
-- 1. Top 5 best-selling books
SELECT b.Title, SUM(o.Quantity) AS Total_Sold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Book b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY b.Title
ORDER BY Total_Sold DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Revenue by genre
SELECT b.Genre, SUM(o.Quantity * b.Price) AS Revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Book b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY b.Genre
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

-- 3. Top customers by total spend
SELECT c.Name, SUM(o.Quantity * b.Price) AS Total_Spend
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customer c ON o.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
JOIN Book b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY Total_Spend DESC
LIMIT 10;
